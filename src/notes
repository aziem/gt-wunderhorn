Boolean simplification:
  Additional checks are needed for this simplification:
  for example, the program:
    int x;
    if (cond) {
      x = 1;
    } else {
      x = 0;
    }
  will inaccurately try to convert x to a boolean

Relation substitution:
  If a relation only appears on the rhs of one Horn Clause,
  then we can substitute its appearances on the LHS with its body.

  However, to do this, any variables that appear in the body need
  to be aliased and the arguments need to be substituted.

Implication simplification:
  true -> e can be changed to e
