## REDUCING NUMBER OF RELATIONS
If more than one line indicates a particular line then that line is a join point.
In general, only:
  Entries
  Joins
  Exits

require relations.

## REDUCING NUMBER OF VARIABLES
If
a program variable is changed on the left hand side of a relation
AND
that same program variable is referenced later in the program.
THEN
The relation must be bound over that variable. Otherwise, it need not be.

Abstract instructions merely contain the ability to make assignments and perform
branches.

Horn clauses add to that the ability to inspect relations.
